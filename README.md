## Play Snake in your Console
The following program uses C++ with NCurses to build a playable game of snake in the console shell. This was a rework of an old assignment from my Advanced Programming Techniquesâ€”CISC 3110 class.
Looking at previous commits dating back 6 years ago, I had no idea what I was doing and it was one of my goals to revisit and fix this project. 

The project was based off of C boilerplate code provided by my professor Scott Dexter.
